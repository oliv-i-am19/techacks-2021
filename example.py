# Creating and sharing new files

# After creating a remote repo, you will want to clone it and create a local copy on your personal machine so that you can easily make changes to the
# project. Once you have created a local repo, you can navigate to the appropriate folder and add/change/remove files as you normally would. 
# When you are done/want to save your work, open up your terminal and navigate to the local repo folder.
# Enter git add <file name> - This tells Git to track a file (AKA tells Git which files have changes that you want to save)
# Enter git commit -m "commit message here" - The commit message is your opportunity to make a note of what changes you made. You MUST include a message!
# Enter git push OR git push origin <branch name> - This pushes all of your local changes to the remote repo. Check the remote repo to see your changes!

print("Congratulations! You've committed and pushed your first changes")
