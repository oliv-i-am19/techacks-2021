# Branching and Pull Requests

# You should use branches to separate working code from buggy/unfinished code. When you create a new branch, it will contain all of the files the parent
# branch contained. Whatever changes you make to the new branch will not appear on the parent branch until you open a pull request and your changes get
# approved.
# Make sure to pull from the remote repo before creating a new branch

# Enter git checkout -b <branch name> - This creates a new branch, named <branch name>, and navigates to it. All changes you make will now exist on the
# new branch.
# When you're done with your changes, add, commit, and push your changes as usual.
# On the remote repo, click on the tab called "Pull requests" and click "New pull request"
# Select which branches you want to compare, AKA which branches you want to merge. Click "Create pull request"
# The owner of the repo will have to review your changes and either approve your pull request (at which point the branches will be merged), or reject it
